This is a simple point-and-click, casual, guessing game.  There are three levels, from Easy to Complex, making the guessing much more difficult.

This is the first version of the game.  I've created a Challenge/Competitive version of this game, which I'll upload in the next release.  Inspired by the theme, and the Number 13 itself.  

It is an engaging and challenging guessing game where players must solve puzzles by uncovering hidden numbers on a game board.  The ultimate goal is to find the elusive number 13 among a series of randomly generated numbers.  Each level presents a grid of circles, each hiding a unique number.  Players click on these circles to reveal the numbers.
